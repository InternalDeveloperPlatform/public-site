# Dynatrace

Dynatrace is a cloud-based monitoring service providing unified observability,
application security and infrastructure monitoring. It is similar to New Relic
and Datadog, though, it provides low-configuration or configuration-less
integration of the services to monitor, as a core differentiator.

On Kubernetes platforms, the Dynatrace instrumentation is injected in workloads
without any need for configuration. While this is convenient, it can have
undesirable side-effects, sometimes, causing operational instability of
services based on certain technology stacks.

Davis AI is a component that claims to automatically draw conclusions on the
root cause of detected operational problems. PurePath is what Dynatrace calls
its tracing and code-level analysis technology, which allows to analyse where
applications spend most of their time, to identify performance bottlenecks and
improvement areas across the entire application stack.

Dynatrace positions itself also as an automation platform, combining the
aspects of service deployment and service monitoring.
