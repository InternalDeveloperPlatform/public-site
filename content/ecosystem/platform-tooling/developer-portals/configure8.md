## What is configure8?

configure8 is an enterprise-grade Internal Developer Portal used for:

- Cataloging everything
- Achieving high standards via Scorecards
- Accelerating velocity via Self-Serve Actions
- Controlling cloud costs via Collaborative Cost Management

Help your developers move faster and build better software by enabling self-serve access to the knowledge and functionality they need.

configure8 core features include:

**Universal Catalog:** A complete and accurate software catalog is the foundation of your portal. It should organize your entire ecosystem – all your applications, services and their dependencies, environments, clusters, cross-cloud and on-prem resources, pipelines, metrics, owners, and much more – and automatically reflect changes. Use it to improve your developers' experience and lay the foundation to achieve high standards, control costs, and self-serve common actions.

**Scorecards:** Achieve high standards for security, DevOps Health and reliability, architecture, migration tracking, and compliance. Leverage configure8's uniquely large library of pre-built checks as well as custom define your own checks to build tailored Scorecards in our no code UI.  Provide developers with an at-a-glance understanding of what needs to be done to improve, and programmatically measure progress as well as keep everyone informed so developers and managers can focus on success instead of writing scripts, maintaining spreadsheets, and hunting for information. You can even include Self-Serve Actions to make it easy for developers to address standards deficiencies as well as use the configure8 Scorecards API to block deployments when a service fails a check to sustain compliance.

**Self-Serve Actions:** Make it easy for application, data and quality engineers to create something new or manage common day 2 operations the right way. Abstract developers from the cognitive load of finding, configuring and executing actions in unfamiliar tools and/or from delays caused by TicketOps bottlenecks. Improve velocity, consistency, and the developer experience.

**Collaborative Cost Management:** Give your engineers daily optics into the cost of operating the code they own, and empower them to take action where appropriate to improve. See and sort costs for services, environments, and resources, understand per resource costs, and a resource's cost drivers. By democratizing access to this knowledge, now your developers can proactively create solutions (whereas before they used to not even know there was an issue). Where appropriate, you can even empower teams to make changes directly. They can size up the blast radius of a change, get a resource's config settings, and then effect change leveraging golden paths defined by your platform team. Compliments existing cloud cost tools designed for central and FinOps teams.

**Delivered as a Solution; Flexible and Fast:** With configure8, you are buying a solution that derisks your success, not a framework to build a tool or a tool. Consultative support at every step of the journey to ensure your effort achieves strong internal adoption and compelling outcomes. configure8 offers tremendous flexibility to tailor the data and security model without bogging you down in laborious set-up work. Get value fast through onboarding automations and a thoughtful workflow, and keep maintenance work light thanks to automated drift avoidance.

### What is the mission and vision of configure8?

We're on a mission to help developers move faster and build better software via self-serve access to the knowledge and functionality they need.

### A brief history of configure8

configure8 was founded in 2021 and launched in 2022. configure8 supports a rapidly growing roster of sophisticated enterprise clients.

configure8 is built by engineers with backgrounds at Microsoft, Google, AWS, NASA and Yahoo! who have experienced the joys and pains of sprawling distributed systems. We've experienced the frustration of bottlenecks due to TicketOps, the limitations of spreadsheets, scripts and static wikis as tools to define and measure compliance with standards, and the stress of getting paged at 2AM for a service we're not that familiar with. We built configure8 to democratize access to the caliber of tooling developers and engineering leaders deserve that was previously reserved for only the very largest global enterprises.
