# Developer Portals & Service Catalogs

_Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) are the sum of all tools and tech that platform engineering teams use to build golden paths for developers. Developer Portals & Service Catalogs are an important category in such a setup. Are we missing any tools?

There is still a lot of confusion about the relationship between Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and Developer Portals.
Gartner recently came up with a clear definition, which we adapt here:

_“Internal **developer portals** serve as the interface through which developers can discover and access **internal developer platform** capabilities.”_
