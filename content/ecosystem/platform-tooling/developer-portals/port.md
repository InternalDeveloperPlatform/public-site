## What is Port?

Port's Developer Portal is a unified, self-service view of the Developer's ecosystem. It consolidates everything Developers need so that it's quick and easy to find.
As a holistic platform, DevPortals have many components to take into account.

**Components of a Developer Portal**

As a holistic platform, DevPortals have many components to take into account.

**Software Catalog Layer**

The Software Catalog Layer is where Developers go to discover the answer to any software question they might have. It's a unified view of the different software components within the organization.

Software components you might find in the Software-Catalog layer often include:

- Microservices
- Cloud Resources (K8S, Lambda, RDS, etc…)
- Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Environments (Production, Staging, QA, Security, DevEnvs…)
- Permissions
- Secrets
- Deployments
  ‍

And that's just the beginning. The many components can also have dependencies between them. For example, managing the Software Catalog layer in a visual representation is essential to answering complex questions.

**Self-Service Layer**

Once you have organized your software components, the self-service layer is where Developers can come to perform actions.

"Deploy this Microservice" or "Add Cloud Resource" are daily tasks for Developers. This is where they can perform actions on the assets you manage within your catalog. This is the front door for everything a developer might need.

**Control Layer**

With a great DevPortal comes great responsibility. Without proper controls in place, security, compliance, and cost controls become chaos.

It's possible to implement a number of control measures across the Software Catalog and Self Service layers.

- **Permissions**: manage access to the data shown in the Software Catalog.
- **Actions**: allow different self-service actions based on a role within the organization.
- **User Tracking**: all actions within the DevPortal are tracked to ensure you stay compliant with current certifications.
- **Automation**: revoke, remediate, revert, and cron-job automations will help set proper processes around DevPortal provisions.

**Product Management Layer**

This just might be my favorite layer. When designing a DevPortal, think like a Product Manager. One that actually understands Developers. Here are a few things to include if your DevPortal is going to be successfully adopted:

1. Wizards and tutorials for new users.
2. Embedded documentation to explain the DevPortal glossary.
3. Custom views for different teams depending on their business function.
4. Chat and support functions are easily accessible at all times.
5. Analytics dashboards to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the DevPortal.

### **What is the mission and vision of Port?**

We believe every developer deserves a best-in-class experience while coding and bringing code to production.

We started Port so every DevEx team can create a DevPortal suitable for their Developers' needs, from Software Catalog to Self-Service actions, all available from one convenient place, up and running in minutes.

### **A brief history of Port**

Port is a brand new product launched in January 2022. Port's founding team has over 10 years of hands-on DevEx expertise.

In the past, we built a DevPortal used by over 1500+ Developers. We saw how a DevPortal affects the Developers' everyday lives at scale.

### **Core features of Port**

- Visibility -- Create a comprehensive catalog by mapping all your software and infrastructure components.
