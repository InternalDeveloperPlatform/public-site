## **What is Cycloid?** [#](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/developer-portals/cycloid/#what-is-cycloid)

Cycloid’s core offer is a developer self-service portal that allows end-users to service their automation, applications and infrastructure needs autonomously. In a full GitOps approach, Cycloid allows DevOps and platform teams to save pre-configured automation parameters in a service catalog, which can then be reused in a simple self-service portal. The portal is complete with modules around Orchestration, Infra-as-Code and resources management, FinOps and GreenOps. 

It is designed to modernize existing infrastructure and automate internal processes while ensuring governance and efficient use of resources. In addition to simplicity, Cycloid also provides fine-grained security guardrails for the DevOps and platform teams, and ways to monitor cloud consumption and carbon footprint. 

The portal supports the three main pillars for sustainable software development: Improving the end-user experience for the team (people), future-proofing infrastructure (profit), and optimizing cloud usage (profit + planet). This results in faster and more stable ROI for exec teams, fewer tickets for platform teams, and a generative culture for end-users and developers.


### **What is the mission and vision of Cycloid? [#](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/developer-portals/cycloid/#what-is-the-mission-and-vision-of-cycloid)**

Cycloid's developer self-service portal aims to empower end-users to interact with tools, cloud, and automation without the need for time-consuming DevOps intervention. Platform teams design, build, and operate the platform, enabling everyone to visualize and deploy both existing and new projects. The service catalog Stacks allows users to reproduce automation parameters across environments, encouraging best practices and compliance in a full GitOps approach.

These parameters can be reused in a simple, user-friendly developer self-service. End-users simply select the service, customize variables, and hit deploy - all without tickets and if needed with approval. The portal is decked out with a cloud cost estimation, allowing end-users to see the financial and environmental impact before they deploy. This information is centralized on the user dashboard and the FinOps & GreenOps module, allowing the executive team to keep track of their spending and resource usage. 

Cycloid supports most aspects of software development including governance, observability, FinOps, and GreenOps, to make it scalable and sustainable for business, people, and the planet. Cycloid is about doing Platform Engineering the right way.


### **A brief history of Cycloid [#](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/developer-portals/cycloid/#a-brief-history-of-cycloid)**

Cycloid has been helping businesses improve operational efficiency and developer experience since 2015. Cycloid's team saw the need to simplify and centralize developer tools in the rising complexity of the IT world. Originally Cycloid was founded with a focus on DevOps and hybrid cloud, helping organizations enforce DevOps best practices, upskill and break down silos, and create automation in a hybrid cloud approach. The simple self-service portal tied all these pieces together, creating a centralized platform for handling automation and increasing transparency between teams. 

As the company grew, more modules on governance, observability, and FinOps + GreenOps were added, making it a more complete Internal Developer Platform experience. 

Today, Cycloid continues to enhance its Internal Developer Platform to help enforce DevOps best practices and the philosophy of sobriety and Green IT, end-user empowerment, transparency, and infrastructure automation in a platform engineering approach.
