**Platform Orchestrators**

Platform Orchestrators are the center piece of any Internal Developer Platform.
A Platform Orchestrator enables Dynamic Configuration Management.

According to *Thoughtworks*, **Platform Orchestrators** are a "new generation of tools that go beyond the traditional platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model and offer published contracts between developers and platform teams. The contract might involve provisioning cloud environments, databases, monitoring, authentication and more in a different environment. These tools enforce organizational standards while granting developers self-service access to variations through configuration."
