# PaaS and DevOps Platforms

Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) are crafted by platform teams to build golden paths and enable developer self-service.
Platform engineering teams follow a _Platform as a Product_ approach to build something that exactly meets the needs of developers in large enterprise setups.

If you don't want to build an IDP on your own, if you don't have the capacity to do proper user research, the talent and resources to bind together a compelling product or if you are just a small startup that quickly wants to build an MVP, a PaaS or end-to-end DevOps Platform might be an alternative.
