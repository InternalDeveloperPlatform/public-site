### What is CodeNOW?

CodeNOW is a cloud-native software development platform that consolidates development, deployment, and operations into one system. It integrates 50+ open-source tools into a cohesive IDP, giving teams self-service environments, automated CI/CD, managed services, and end-to-end observability, without the need to assemble or operate their own toolchain.

CodeNOW dynamically generates app and infrastructure configurations for every deployment, enabling platform teams to drive standardization through reusable templates and scaffolding. Developers self-serve the tech and tools they need through the web UI, CLI, or REST API, driving productivity and velocity across the organization.

CodeNOW works with any cloud provider, ensuring zero vendor lock-in. Built on proven open-source technologies (Kubernetes, Tekton, Istio, Prometheus, Grafana, ArgoCD, Vault, and more), organizations maintain full control over their code, infrastructure, and intellectual property.

### Mission and Vision of CodeNOW

CodeNOW's mission is to make modern software delivery sustainable, secure, and efficient by standardizing cloud-native development across teams. Its vision is to provide a ready-made golden path that accelerates delivery, ensures regulatory compliance, reduces operational waste, and equips organizations for AI-enabled development.

CodeNOW follows a platform-as-product approach, where platform teams behave as product teams, iterating on the platform based on feedback from their customers—the development teams. This ensures the platform evolves to meet real needs while maintaining zero lock-in and full IP ownership for organizations.

### A brief history of CodeNOW

Founded in 2014 by Petr Svoboda, CodeNOW began as a platform simplifying cloud native application development and Kubernetes adoption. It grew into a full Internal Developer Platform used by companies in regulated and distributed environments. Over time, the platform expanded to support multi-cloud delivery, governance, observability and AI-ready features.

### Core features of CodeNOW

- **Integrated toolchain**
  Combines Kubernetes, Tekton, Istio, Prometheus/Grafana and other open-source tools into a single platform.

- **Developer self-service**
  Creation of fully provisioned environments, service creation with default configs, resource provisioning (databases, storage, DNS), and automated deployments. Full visibility into which services are running in which state across all environments.

- **Preview environments**
  Preview builds and environments per pull-request, enabling teams to test infrastructure, databases, and applications before merging to production.

- **Automated DevOps**
  Template-driven CI/CD powered by Tekton pipelines, self-service environments, consistent deployment policies, and secure promotion flows.

- **Multi-cloud deployment**
  Runs across AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, private cloud, and on-prem Kubernetes clusters with consistent delivery patterns.

- **Security, compliance & governance**
  Built-in RBAC, audit logs, secrets management (HashiCorp Vault), mTLS everywhere via Istio service mesh, and ISO27001 certification. Workflows aligned with CRA, DORA, and industry standards.

- **DORA metrics & performance tracking**
  Built-in tracking of DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate) with benchmarking against elite performers, enabling teams to measure and improve software delivery performance.

- **End-to-end observability**
  Integrated logging (Grafana Loki), tracing (Jaeger), and monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) out of the box, with service mesh visualization via Kiali.

- **API-first architecture**
  REST API enables integration into backends, GitOps processes, or custom UIs for enhanced workflow automation and interoperability.

- **Templates & scaffolding**
  Production-ready scaffolder templates enable teams to start building in minutes, accelerating onboarding for new projects and developers.

- **Managed services**
  One-click provisioning of databases and services including PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Keycloak, MinIO, and CockroachDB.

- **Sustainable cloud-native development**
  Standardization reduces tool sprawl, cloud cost waste, and long-term operational burden.

- **AI integration**
  Provides secure patterns and environments for deploying ML and generative AI features in cloud-native applications.

- **Vendor management**
  Ensures internal teams and external vendors follow the same golden path and quality gates, with full IP ownership and the ability to switch vendors without lock-in.
