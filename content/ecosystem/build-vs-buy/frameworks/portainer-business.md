# Portainer Business

**Claim:** An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) for containers.

**Focus:** Platform Engineers use Portainer to provide developers a secure API proxy, golden path policies & templates, and to centralize authentication and access management. Developers use Portainer to manually deploy applications, setup self-service GitOps pipelines, triage deployments, and understand the runtime state of their containers

**What is Portainer.io?**
Portainer is a centralised management platform that enables non-expert operators (Admins, Devs) to complete expert tasks. Over 1M users trust Portainer to help them with their Container management EVERY MONTH.

Platform Administrators use Portainer to centrally manage their container platforms, be those Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes or Nomad; locally, in the datacenter, cloud, or at the edge. Portainer makes configuring and enforcing centralised authentication and access control (IAM) a breaze, through our LDAP/AD/oAuth support, and integrated SSO. Portainer facilitates all Kubernetes RBAC allocations, allowing admins to easily assign restricted roles to users. Portainer also allows the admins to define sensible/safe/secure default policies and templates that all developers must operate within.
Developers use Portainer to go from manually deploying their applications for testing (no-code/low-cost deployments), through to establishing their own fully automatic GitOps pipelines. Developers can easily inspect, triage and monitor the performance and resource consumption of running apps.

Portainer offers an integrated WebUI that is incredibly intuitive, responsive, and available across any browser. This WebUI allows every aspect of Portainer to be used, without needing anything installed on local devices. The WebUI also includes an embedded KubeCTL shell, when you need a little more control over what you are doing.
Portainer also provides a fully compliant Kubernetes API proxy, allowing dev or ops teams to use any Kubernetes native tooling through Portainer, whilst ensuring compliance with any golden-paths defined by the Platform administrators.
Portainer is an API first product, so everything that can be done in our WebUI can be managed using our well documented API.
