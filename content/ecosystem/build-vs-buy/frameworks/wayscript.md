What is WayScript?
---------------------

WayScript is an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that enables scalable, single click development environments. The platform empowers early stage, high growth engineering teams with scalable, modern infrastructure so they can focus on product instead of battling Ops.

With WayScript, spin up customizable development environments which integrate Docker, Kubernetes, and all your third-party dev tooling (GitHub, Datadog, New Relic, PagerDuty, Jenkins, CircleCI, Auth0, etc.). WayScript removes the activation energy for internal tools, and unlocks rapid testing, staging, and production environments. WayScript is pre-configured to each organization’s business and security standards, so as you scale, WayScript ensures that all development is meeting internal policies.

WayScript is self-hosted, air-gapped, and SOC-2 Type 2 compliant and spins up in under 1 hour on your AWS. To see a demo, book a time with us [here](https://meetings.hubspot.com/peter-jadovich) or email us at admins@wayscript.com.

The Platform: 
* Stands up in 1 hour 
* Provides instant infrastructure in a box 
* Increases internal tooling output by 50% 
* Alleviates DevOps/SRE overhead & hiring need
