# One2N

One2N is a boutique consulting company specializing in cloud-native solutions that help businesses optimize their cloud and datacenter infrastructure and operations. One2N helps modernize your application to make it cloud-native ready.
They help to build cloud-native architectures without vendor lock-ins, resulting in massive cost savings.

One2N operates in the Platform Engineering space, enabling engineering teams to build and deploy Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and empowering engineering teams to deploy confidently and independently through self-serve platforms.

One2N's approach combines open-source IDP tooling with practical platform engineering, ensuring transparency and reliability from Kubernetes-based preview environments to 'airplane mode' local development setups that work without internet connectivity.
